### Contents

These are the Contents which are available are listed below.

| Name of the Folder | Content Inside |
|:------------------:|:--------------:|
| [Source](./Source-Code)| Contains ".java" files |
| [Class-File](./Java-Class-Files)| Contains ".class" files |
|[Examples](./Example-Files)| These are just example files I made when testing the programme|

You may notice that there is an [compile.py](./sourcecode/compile.py). It is a python based file which seperates the class files from the java source code files and places each of them in a different directory. The purpose of it is only that. I used it because I wanted to make things look tidy. 

Please contribute to this repository.
